# Key concepts and getting started

Iodide is tool designed to make Web-based scientific communication and computation more accessible to scientists by bringing them a low friction iterative workflow in a familiar environment influenced by tools such as Jupyter, R-Studio, and the MATLAB IDE. We belive that the Web provides an unparalled platform for communicating scientific ideas with easily shareable interactive data visualization and accessible beautiful write up, but that modern Web development seems slow, cumbersome, and unapproachable to most scientists.

Iodide is in good company with many other excellent tools for exploring and prototyping Javascript, and it may be used just in that capacity, but unlike many of those tools, Iodide is focused on allowing you to easily create and share an uncluttered "report", a presentable document that looks how _you_ want it to look, and that is not mixed with code or other distracting UI elements. For those familiar with R-Markdown, the workflow will be familiar: code and written material are combined within a document as desired, but the final output is a nicely formatted presentational document. In the case of R-Markdown, that document is typically a PDF, but in Iodide that output is a fully interactive Web document, capable of running it's own live Javascript (_and other languages via WebAssembly!_), and with full access to the browser's complete set of capabilities.
